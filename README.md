# Self-Adaptive Body Sensor Network (SA-BSN)

This is an implementation of the SA-BSN. So far, the BSN was used for experimentation on solutions for adaptation on the Self-Adaptive Software Systems domain, refer to https://doi.org/10.1145/3194133.3194147 and https://doi.org/10.1109/SEAMS.2019.00020 for more information.  Moreover, information regarding the prototype behaviour and how to develop your own manager is provided in the https://bodysensornetwork.herokuapp.com/ website, which contains an executable instance of the BSN. The following instructions will guide you to to compile, deploy and run the BSN on Linux Ubuntu 18.04 with ROS Melodic distributions. We have not yet tested on other distributions. Check our Youtube video for a demonstration of the BSN: https://youtu.be/iDEd_tW9JZE

There are two ways to install and use the SA-BSN:

1) Use our ready-to-go Ubuntu Virtual Machine

    1.1. Download, extract and mount the .vbox
    
    1.2. Execute the SA-BSN
 
2) Build from scratch.

    2.1. Download and Install Dependencies
    
    2.2. Execute the SA-BSN
    
Below we further detail how to proceed to get BSN running following each of the ways above.  

## 1. Detailed instructions via our ready-to-go Ubuntu VM 

### 1.1) Download, Extract and Mount the bsn.vbox

Download the bsn virtual box from (https://drive.google.com/file/d/18APQNBNZM7Pp_bFGyuChOH1uivf4YEV1/view?usp=sharing)

Then, extract it. It is recommend for Ubuntu 20.04 users to extract it with unrar.

Finally, mount the bsn.vbox with your favorite VM Manager (we recommend VirtualBox)

The password from the virtual machine is the same as the user. So,

```
user: bsn
password: bsn
```

### 1.2) Execute the SA-BSN

Configure roslaunch files for personalized execution under '/catkin_ws/src/bsn/configurations';

Execute the BSN either by executing the pre-set run.sh file, that executes all nodes, 
or use roslaunch x.launch to execute a single node:
```
cd ~/catkin_ws/src/bsn/ && 
bash run.sh 600
``` 

For this example we chose to use the run.sh script with 600 seconds of execution time, but it can be any user-defined value. If no value is provided , the default value used is 300 seconds (5 minutes).

#### Logs' Analysis
After running the system, four log files of the execution will appear inside the 'bsn_ros/src/knowledge_repository/resource/logs' folder. Remember that each execution generates different log files in the form logName_logID, where the logID is the timestamp of the beginning of the execution.

In order to analyze these log files, one can run the Analyzer python code inside the 'bsn_ros/src/simulation/analyzer' folder using the following command

```
cd ~/catkin_ws/src/bsn_ros/src/simulation/analyzer/
python3 analyzer.py [logID] [metric] [plot_component_metrics] [setpoint]
```

where:

* [logID] is the ID for the execution log files previously mentioned.
* [metric] is the metric to be analyzed, which values can be twofold: (1) reliability or (2) cost.
* [plot_component_metrics] is a parameter that defines if the graphic which will be shown at the end of analysis will contain components local reliabilities or not. The components local reliabilities will be present if this is equal to True or true and only the system's global reliability will be present otherwise.
* [setpoint] will be the value of the setpoint used in the execution. This needs to be the same as the one defined in the System Manager launch file.

One example of the command usage would be:

```
python3 analyzer.py 1610549979516318295 reliability False 0.9
```
## 2. Detailed instructions to build the BSN from scratch

### 2.1) Download and Install Dependencies

Dependencies:

* [Ros Melodic](http://wiki.ros.org/melodic) which provides software libraries for BSN engines.
* [Lepton](https://github.com/rdinizcal/lepton) ("lightweight expression parser") is a small C++ library for parsing, evaluating, differentiating, and analyzing mathematical expressions.
* [Bsn Library](https://github.com/rdinizcal/libbsn)  provides the implementation of sensors, data fusers and emergency detection
* [Bsn arch](https://github.com/rdinizcal/arch)

#### Robotic Operating System (ROS):
First it is required to install ROS Melodic. Our development team is strictly using Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic). To install it please follow this [link](http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu).  
Also, it is strongly advised to use catkin for managing the ROS packages, refer to this [link](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/InstallingandConfiguringROSEnvironment) after installing ROS Melodic. As such you will need to create a catkin workspace. You can do so by following the steps:

```
mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
cd ~/catkin_ws/
catkin_make
```

#### Lepton, Libbsn 

First, clone and install [Lepton](https://github.com/rdinizcal/lepton) and [Libbsn](https://github.com/rdinizcal/libbsn).

Then, clone the bsn:

```
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/lesunb/bsn.git
```

When cloned, go to the 'bsn_ros' folder and then proceed to install the dependencies

```
cd bsn_ros
```

Inside the 'bsn_ros' folder, simply run the following command to effectively install and build the 3 dependencies:

```
bash install.sh
```

### 2.2) Execute the SA-BSN

Same instructions as 1.2.

## Common Mistakes

### In case or error due to the ROS path

You might want to source the setup.bash inside the catkin workspace:
```
echo "source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```
